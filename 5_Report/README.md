• As part of this project, we will submit a test suite for testing some of the functions you
  implement in rps.cpp. It is important to note that you will only be testing your program for
  invalid input rather than bad input. For the purposes of this document, “bad input” will refer
  to input whose type (char, int, double, etc.) is different than what is expected by your program.
  So if your program is expecting that the user will input an integer — you are guaranteed to
  always receive input of type int and will not receive something like char, which would be
  considered bad input. On the other hand, you will be testing for “invalid input,” which has the
  correct type but is considered invalid given the program specification. The RMEs will be clear
  about what is considered to be invalid input for a specific function.
