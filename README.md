A game called Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) involves two players simultaneously choosing either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). Informally, the rules of the game are that “rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper”. If two players choose the same item then the round is a tie.
